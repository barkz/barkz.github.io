I spent an amazing week at Glean's BOOSTcamp meeting incredible people.

While talking to the Systems Engineering about their developer conversations I was compelled to develop some examples of how quickly you can create a custom Chat API application.

So, Glean ChitChat was born.

![glean-chitchat](/assets/posts/Create_Your_Own_ChatApp.png)

It is not intended to be a feature complete solution. I created this to showcases how easily you can develop a chat application with our APIs.

Features

* Input a query to ask your question.
* Display multiple query results with the most recent on top.
* Retains your query history at the bottom to see what you have asked.

Super simple and all written in just 145 lines of Python code. Grab it from my Glean GitHub repo, [glean-chitchat](https://github.com/rob-barker-glean/glean-chitchat).

I developed this in Visual Studio Code. There are some debug outputs that you can monitor in the Terminal. 

Libraries used:

```python
# Libraries
import sys
import requests
import json
import markdown

# UI elements
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QWidget, QVBoxLayout, QLabel, QLineEdit, QTextBrowser, QPushButton, QComboBox
```

If you are current Glean customer, feel free to fork, play around and see how you can extend.

If you aren't a Glean customer, check out our [Glean Developer site](https://developers.glean.com) to learn more about our APIs.
