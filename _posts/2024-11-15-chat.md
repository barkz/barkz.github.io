I spent an amazing week at Glean's BOOSTcamp. This was an event for new Gleanies joining the company to learn about sales, product features, architecture, get hands on with labs and socialize to get to know each other.

There was a wide range of people from account exectives, systems engineers, business development, executives and technical enablement team members. 

I spent a lot of time talking to the Systems Engineering about the conversations with developers. Glean's Platform is based on a core set of APIs to enable the creation of custom solutions. This led me to spend some time and quickly put together a simple Chat API application.

So, Glean ChitChat was born.

I created this to showcase how easily you can develop a chat application with our APIs.

Basic capabilities:

* Input a query to ask your question.
* Display multiple query results with the most recent on top.
* Retains your query history at the bottom to see what you have asked.

This is very basic and written in just 145 lines of Python code. Fork it from my Glean GitHub repo, [glean-chitchat](https://github.com/rob-barker-glean/glean-chitchat).

I developed this in the best editor, Visual Studio Code. The Python libraries that are used:

```python
# Libraries
import sys
import requests
import json
import markdown

# UI elements
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QWidget, QVBoxLayout, QLabel, QLineEdit, QTextBrowser, QPushButton, QComboBox
```

Again, it is a simple example but shows how easy it is to use our APIs. 

If you are current Glean customer, feel free to fork, play around and see how you can extend.

If you aren't a Glean customer, check out our [Glean Developer site](https://developers.glean.com) to learn more about our APIs.
